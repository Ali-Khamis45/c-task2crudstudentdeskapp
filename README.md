# Student Registration System

Welcome to my Student Registration App. I built this desktop application using C# Windows Forms to apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and practice handling file streams.

## Features

* Full CRUD Operations: Add, read, update, and delete student records easily.
* Clean OOP Architecture: The code is divided logically. Instead of putting everything in the UI form, I created a Student model and a SchoolDbContext class to act as the data layer.
* Image Handling via IO Streams: The application uses FileStream to read uploaded profile pictures from the device and MemoryStream to display them in the UI.

## Tech Stack

* Language: C#
* Framework: .NET (Windows Forms)
